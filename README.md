# Command-Mode
Makes your Windows 7-11 device boot into a setup-like state where you have a command prompt and almost full access to your windows install!

Notes before you install
It is recommended to complete a normal restart on your device before launching Command Mode for the first time
If you start it instatly, it may cause some errors!
Do not enter the 'exit' command in the Command Mode window, doing so may cause errors when signing in normally!

Inspired by MS-DOS mode created by Enderman
